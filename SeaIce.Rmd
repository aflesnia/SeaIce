# Introduction
Sea Ice  

> I know words.  I have the best words.  ~ Donald Trump

# Materials and methods

Narrative and most code will go here.  Describe what you are doing and show how to do it (with code).

You can do bullets like this:
C:\Users\Local1\Documents\R Project


* The first most important thing
* The second most important thing
* The third most important thing

You can do numbers like this:

1. The first most important thing
2. The second most important thing
3. The third most important thing

See [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for all the amazing things you can do.


Here's my first code chunk.
```{r}
1+2
```

Load any required packages in a code chunk (you may need to install some packages):
```{r}
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
```
```{r}
thickness03 <- raster("C:/Users/Local1/Documents/R Project/laser1_thickness_mskd.tif")
plot(thickness03)
thickness08 <- raster("C:/Users/Local1/Documents/R Project/laser3k_thickness_mskd.tif")
plot(thickness08)
spplot(stack(thickness03, thickness08))
boundary <- readOGR(dsn = "C:/Users/Local1/Documents/R Project/ARPA_polygon",layer = "ARPA_polygon")
boundary <- boundary[boundary$OBJECTID==2,]
projection(thickness03) <- CRS(proj4string(boundary))
projection(thickness08) <- CRS(proj4string(boundary))
thickness03_mask <- mask(thickness03, boundary)
names(thickness03_mask) <- "Sea Ice Thickness in 2003"
thickness08_mask <- mask(thickness08, boundary)
names(thickness08_mask) <- "Sea Ice Thickness in 2008"
spplot(stack(thickness03_mask, thickness08_mask))
diff <- thickness08_mask - thickness03_mask
names(diff) <- "Difference in Ice Thickness"
spplot(diff)
``` 





```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(spocc)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)  # cache the results for quick compiling
```


We are going to use the `occ()` function to download _occurrence_ records for the American robin (_Turdus migratorius_) from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](gbif.org).

```{r, warning=F} 
## define which species to query
sp='Turdus migratorius'

## run the query and convert to data.frame()
d = occ(query=sp, from='ebird',limit = 100) %>% occ2df()
```
This can take a few seconds.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Map illustrating the known occurrence locations"}
# Load coastline
map=map_data("world")
1
ggplot(d,aes(x=longitude,y=latitude))+
  geom_polygon(aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group),data=map)+
  geom_point(col="red")+
  coord_equal()
1+2

```


# Results

Show tables, plots, etc. and describe them.

# Conclusions

What have you learned?  Are there any broader implications?
